### Week Summary: Counting, Data, and Listening in Digital Archaeology

**Focus of the Week:**
This week, we explored how *counting* can either hide or highlight aspects of the past. The emphasis was on how digital tools structure our understanding of archaeological evidence. We worked with:

* **CSVs**
* **SQL**
* **Basic statistical methods**


### Listening Reflections

#### 1. **Dr. Colleen Morgan**

I was particularly struck by her discussion of *drawing* in archaeology. Initially, I wasn’t sure whether she meant literal illustration or something more conceptual, like drawing inferences. She described it as a skill that is fading, and one that we should continue to cultivate, because it trains us to slow down and attend closely.

What gave her *hope* was the ongoing work of students and researchers who use digital archaeology to challenge colonial legacies and resist fascist narratives. She even offers microgrants to support this type of work. Hearing this reshaped how I think about archaeology.

I used to imagine archaeologists as intruders: people in cargo shorts digging into worlds that do not belong to them. But now I’m beginning to understand that excavation can be an act of **care**, a way of reclaiming truth. If only the hunter tells the story, the lion is always the loser. When people return to excavate their *own* histories, the story changes. The data becomes truth.



#### 2. **Ben Carter**

Ben Carter’s work on charcoal production in Pennsylvania was another example of how small traces can carry enormous meaning. His use of heat maps and geographic data shows how a tiny clue can open into a full historical narrative. In archaeology,I'm finding, a *little* information can tell you **a lot**.

He emphasized that digital archaeology is not “better,” but that it can produce cleaner and more accessible data. With that comes a responsibility: we owe transparency and clarity to the communities our research affects.

His hope comes from the *density* of conversation happening online. Researchers share constantly, whether through formal writing or informal channels such as Twitter. Because of that, the work circulates. 



### Reading Reflection: Labrador & Angela

The readings reinforced the idea that research is strongest when it is *shared* and *collaborative*. Inviting the public into archaeological interpretation, like in the Holocaust museum project, allows people to witness how narratives are constructed. This helps break down bias and makes the process of history visible.

Both the readings and the lectures suggest that collaboration is not an accessory to archaeology; it is **the method**. Shared inquiry creates shared truth.



### Emerging Personal Understanding

Through all of this, I’m beginning to see archaeology as:

* an act of finding truth
* a method of reclaiming narrative,
* and a way of restoring stories to the people they belong to.

The more I learn, the more I understand that excavation is not just about objects, but about **justice, memory, and truth**.

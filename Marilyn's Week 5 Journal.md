### Week Summary: Counting, Data, and Listening in Digital Archaeology

**Focus of the Week:**
This week, we explored how *counting* can either hide or highlight aspects of the past. The emphasis was on how digital tools structure our understanding of archaeological evidence. We worked with:

* **CSVs**
* **SQL**
* **Basic statistical methods**


### Listening Reflections

#### 1. **Dr. Colleen Morgan**

I was particularly struck by her discussion of *drawing* in archaeology. Initially, I wasn’t sure whether she meant literal illustration or something more conceptual, like drawing inferences. She described it as a skill that is fading, and one that we should continue to cultivate, because it trains us to slow down and attend closely.

What gave her *hope* was the ongoing work of students and researchers who use digital archaeology to challenge colonial legacies and resist fascist narratives. She even offers microgrants to support this type of work. Hearing this reshaped how I think about archaeology.

I used to imagine archaeologists as intruders: people in cargo shorts digging into worlds that do not belong to them. But now I’m beginning to understand that excavation can be an act of **care**, a way of reclaiming truth. If only the hunter tells the story, the lion is always the loser. When people return to excavate their *own* histories, the story changes. The data becomes truth.



#### 2. **Ben Carter**

Ben Carter’s work on charcoal production in Pennsylvania was another example of how small traces can carry enormous meaning. His use of heat maps and geographic data shows how a tiny clue can open into a full historical narrative. In archaeology,I'm finding, a *little* information can tell you **a lot**.

He emphasized that digital archaeology is not “better,” but that it can produce cleaner and more accessible data. With that comes a responsibility: we owe transparency and clarity to the communities our research affects.

His hope comes from the *density* of conversation happening online. Researchers share constantly, whether through formal writing or informal channels such as Twitter. Because of that, the work circulates. 



### Reading Reflection: Labrador & Angela

The readings reinforced the idea that research is strongest when it is *shared* and *collaborative*. Inviting the public into archaeological interpretation, like in the Holocaust museum project, allows people to witness how narratives are constructed. This helps break down bias and makes the process of history visible.

Both the readings and the lectures suggest that collaboration is not an accessory to archaeology; it is **the method**. Shared inquiry creates shared truth.

### Reflection on Digital Literacy and Data Reuse

One of the readings that stayed with me this week was the discussion of digital literacy and data reuse. There’s a popular question: *What’s in a name?* And the answer, according to this reading, is **everything**. But that everything is only meaningful if we know how to *read* it.

The reuse of archaeological data requires an understanding of the **context** in which it was collected:

* Who gathered it
* What they thought was important
* The descriptive language they used
* The assumptions and frameworks shaping their interpretation

If I, as an archaeologist, inherit a dataset that someone else created, I am also inheriting their language and worldview. And because there is **no widely shared, standardized digital literacy** in archaeology, data becomes extremely difficult to pass on. The records may exist, but the meanings become inaccessible.

So the question becomes:
**How do we reuse data when we don’t share the same literacy to interpret it?**

If there is no common language, then each dataset risks becoming isolated. Information can be archived yet still lost. The loss is not physical, but interpretative. We end up with records that are present and preserved, but effectively unreadable.

This means that a *lack of shared digital literacy is itself a form of historical erasure.*

It made me think about how many stories might already be lost simply because:

* the data was stored without communal interpretive tools,
* the knowledge required to read it wasn’t passed down,
* or the people receiving the archive didn’t have access to the frameworks needed to understand it.

We always talk about history being erased intentionally, but this showed me a quieter kind of erasure:
**the erasure that happens when things are preserved without the means to interpret them.**

Digital archaeology, then, is not only about collecting data.
It is about *teaching the language* of that data.

### Emerging Personal Understanding

Through all of this, I’m beginning to see archaeology as:

* an act of finding truth
* a method of reclaiming narrative,
* and a way of restoring stories to the people they belong to.

The more I learn, the more I understand that excavation is not just about objects, but about **justice, memory, and truth**.

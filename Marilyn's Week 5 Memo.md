### Memo: What Didn’t Work This Week + What I’m Learning

There were a few technical issues this week that disrupted my workflow. The two links for the *Data Feminism* article didn’t open for me. I started with the link provided in the Learning Hub, and when that failed, I reached out in the Reddit group. My TA shared an alternative link Dr. Graham had posted earlier, but when I tried it in Chrome, the page froze and became unresponsive. So I wasn’t able to read that article at all this week.

I also ran into trouble with Hypothesis during the digital literacy reading, although it worked smoothly for the other readings. Once it did start working, though, I actually really enjoyed the collaborative aspect of reading alongside everyone. Seeing other people’s highlights and annotations made the text feel more approachable. It was like being in a classroom, even though we’re not physically together. The comments helped me navigate the heavier sections, and responding to my classmates felt like participating in a shared conversation of understanding. It helped me see how other people were processing the same material in real time.

I’m also recognizing my improvement. I felt very unsure of myself during Module 1 — especially around how to structure my `.md` files, upload them, and stay organized in the repository. But now I feel more stable. I understand my workflow better, I know how to set things up, and that’s giving me confidence as we move forward. Even though I know there will be more complex coding coming up in Week 6, I feel ready. I feel like I’ve found my rhythm.

### Memo: What Didn’t Work This Week + What I’m Learning

There were a few technical issues this week that disrupted my workflow. The two links for the *Data Feminism* article didn’t open for me. I started with the link provided in the Learning Hub, and when that failed, I reached out in the Reddit group. My TA shared an alternative link Dr. Graham had posted earlier, but when I tried it in Chrome, the page froze and became unresponsive. So I wasn’t able to read that article at all this week.

I also ran into trouble with Hypothesis during the digital literacy reading, although it worked smoothly for the other readings. Once it did start working, though, I actually really enjoyed the collaborative aspect of reading alongside everyone. Seeing other people’s highlights and annotations made the text feel more approachable. It was like being in a classroom, even though we’re not physically together. The comments helped me navigate the heavier sections, and responding to my classmates felt like participating in a shared conversation of understanding. It helped me see how other people were processing the same material in real time.

I’m also recognizing my improvement. I felt very unsure of myself during Module 1 — especially around how to structure my `.md` files, upload them, and stay organized in the repository. But now I feel more stable. I understand my workflow better, I know how to set things up, and that’s giving me confidence as we move forward. Even though I know there will be more complex coding coming up in Week 6, I feel ready. I feel like I’ve found my rhythm.

I hear you. And I want you to know that everything you just described makes *complete* sense. This is exactly the kind of confusion **everyone** hits at this stage, even if they don’t say it out loud. The feeling of *“I understand the ideas, but the tools are not working and I can’t even start the exercises”* is real, and it’s exhausting.


### Additional Memo: Technical Challenges and Frustration

After completing the readings, I moved on to the exercises and tried to run the SQL BITER environment, but it didn’t work. The instructions mentioned files in the “dispenser,” but I couldn’t locate any links to download them. I wasn’t sure whether there were supposed to be multiple files or just one, and there was no clear direction on where to access them.

I then tried to install the Python SQL package by copying the code provided into my notebook, but nothing ran. I didn't know which part I was actually meant to copy, and every attempt led to errors or no response. At that point I felt stuck, and it became difficult to tell where to begin or how to troubleshoot it.

This was really discouraging. I understand the theoretical material well, and I enjoyed the readings, but I’m struggling with the coding and technical setup. Without being in a physical class where I can turn to someone next to me for clarification, it feels isolating. I reached out on Discord and messaged my TA, but I didn’t receive responses in time to help me move forward. It left me feeling overwhelmed, like everyone else is progressing except me.

Even though I feel frustrated, I am not giving up. I am documenting these challenges because they are real, and they affect my ability to complete the exercises. I also recognize that I am getting more comfortable with my `.md` files and workflow in general, which shows I *am* learning. I just need more guidance on the coding environment to continue.
